## **Coin Viz tools**
### **Coin Quote**
Input cryptocurrency transactions from past dates to calculate total and weighted average costs, and profit/loss. Individual transactions are recorded separately in a table.

### **24Hr volume chart**
Shows cryptocurrency-fiat volume from the past 24 hours. Volume are measured in fiat currencies to allow comparison across multiple cryptocurrencies.

#### **Data sources**
All data is provided through [CryptoCompare's API](https://www.cryptocompare.com).
Because the data is aggregated, and doesn't take exchange fees, etc. into account, it is not inteded to replace users' actual transaction records. The tool helps users visualize profit/loss but does not retrieve users' exact (real life) costs.

This is not financial advice :D
